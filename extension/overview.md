related to Power Platform. This includes synchronization of solution metadata
(a.k.a. solutions) between development environments and source control,
generating build artifacts, deploying to downstream environments,
provisioning/de-provisioning of environments, and the ability to perform
static analysis checks against your solution using the PowerApps checker
service.
